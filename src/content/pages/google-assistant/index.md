[**Scrabble Word Checker**](https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/000000d3fdb78966?hl=en_in). 

<br>

Although other solutions for word checking for Scrabble already exist, I found them to be tedious and the UI, inaccesible. I realized that a solution leveraging something approachable like Google Assistant could fill that space, convenient and handy. 

<br>

Scrabble Word Checker checks relevant Scrabble Dictionaries, compares rules, and return a tile score along with the query. 

<br>

A quick "Hey, Google. Ask Scrabble Word Checker if 'gullible' is a valid Scrabble word?" is all you need.

Privacy Policy for my Google Assistant Actions  
===============================

<br>

This document serves as the privacy policy and describes how I (Ayush Yembarwar) ["subwayHareArmy", "me" or "I"] protect your ["you", "user" or "customer"] privacy and keep your personal data safe.
Be sure to read this policy as well as Google's [Google Privacy and Terms](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-in), and [Google Assistant Privacy Settings](https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/7126196?hl=en&ref_topic=7110546).

<br>

If you use an action, you fully agree to this privacy policy.


General  
-------  

When the user activates an action, their voice input is sent to Google and is processed to realize the user's intent.

<br>

This data exchange is not avoidable.


Data  
----  

I do not collect any other user data for any Google Assistant Actions.

<br>

Google's Cloud Functions Console logs data of the form of the frequency of requests and utterances(not tied to a specific user) as a part of their analytics package for improvements.


Changes  
-------  

The Actions and the Privacy Policy might change at a later point of time, as a part of the changes and updates made to the Actions.

<br>

Your continued use of the Action after changes of the Privacy Policy or the Action itself will be seen as your acceptance of both.
