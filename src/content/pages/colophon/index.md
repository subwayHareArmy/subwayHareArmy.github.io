## About this site

I designed and built this site myself. It's a home to share things I'm exploring and things I've built. It's a place for me to learn in public.

All code is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/evadecker/evadecker.com). The first commit was December 5, 2018, but the earliest version of this site dates back to 2015, an era when I eschewed versioning and uploaded files manually via <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr>. I've grown a lot since then—and the technology around me has grown, too.

## Technology

This site is built using [Astro](https://astro.build). Astro handles the content-heavy views (written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com)), but for more interactive components I use [React](https://react.dev) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).

Code is edited using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) on a [MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/). My terminal of choice is [Warp](https://www.warp.dev). My go-to coding font is [MonoLisa](https://www.monolisa.dev).

End-to-end tests are written using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev), and I use [Polypane](https://polypane.app) to preview devices, test accessibility, and toggle user preferences like `(prefers-color-scheme)`.

Domain registration, hosting, and deployment are via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Email forwarding is through [ImprovMX](https://improvmx.com). I send occasional [newsletters](https://buttondown.email/notesfromeva) using [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email).

## Typography

Body text is set in [Minion](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/minion-3), while headings and UI are set in [Franklin Gothic URW](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/franklin-gothic-urw). Both typefaces are served via [Adobe Fonts](https://fonts.adobe.com). Typography is scaled using a lot of math and a [fluid type scale](https://utopia.fyi/blog/designing-with-fluid-type-scales) by [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/type/calculator/), meaning that font sizes will interpolate between mobile and desktop to optimize for the current browser width.

Type inspiration can be found anywhere, from comic art and video games to bodega window displays, but I often return to a handful of resources:

- [_The Elements of Typographic Style_](https://bookshop.org/a/97627/9780881792126) by Robert Bringhurst
- [Butterick’s Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com)
- Bethany Heck’s [Font Review Journal](https://fontreviewjournal.com)
- [Fonts In Use](https://fontsinuse.com)

## Styling

I use [Radix Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors) to apply palettes consistently, ensure accessibility, and seamlessly switch between light and dark mode. Icons are from [Remix Icon](https://remixicon.com). Styles are written using plain 'ol CSS. I [don’t use a grid](https://gridless.design). Pixel portraits of me were created by [@NullTheFool](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@NullTheFool) on the [Pixel Art Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pixelart). Pixelated header images are created using the Atkinson dithering algorithm via [Dithermark](https://app.dithermark.com).

## Sounds

The toy synth uses samples from [Mixkit](https://mixkit.co/), [Bolder Sounds](https://www.boldersounds.com/index.php?main_page=product_music_info&products_id=71), [Freesound](https://freesound.org/people/Samulis/packs/21029/), [Soundpacks](https://soundpacks.com/free-sound-packs/xylophone-samples-pack/), [Philharmonia Orchestra Sound Samples](https://www.philharmonia.co.uk/explore/sound_samples/banjo), [Precisionsound](https://store.precisionsound.net/shop/peruvian-ocarina/), [HearthSounds](https://maxtimkovich.com/hearthsounds?q=murloc), and [The Mushroom Kingdom](https://themushroomkingdom.net/media/smw/wav).

## Energy

I minimize energy usage on this site by avoiding unnecessary scripts (such as trackers, analytics, or resource-intensive animations) and compressing images and video.

> The internet consumes a lot of electricity. 416.2TWh per year to be precise. To give you some perspective, that's more than the entire United Kingdom.
> <cite>[Website Carbon Calculator](https://www.websitecarbon.com)</cite>

As of October 18, 2023, [carbon results for evadecker.com](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/evadecker-com/) indicate that the home page is **cleaner than 95% of web pages tested**, producing **0.05g of CO<sub>2</sub> per page view**. The site uses [Vercel's serverless architecture](https://vercel.com/guides/what-is-vercel-green-energy-policy#) to further cut energy consumption.
