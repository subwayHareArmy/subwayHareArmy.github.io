As a designer, I've always referred to my website as _my portfolio._ It was a place, at first, for images. Visuals, pixel-perfection. Then it grew into a repository for case studies. Narratives about work I'd done—the problems I was presented, how I (and teams) tackled them, and the solutions we came to. And then my portfolio was nothing. Just a name and an email. You can do this once you've reach a certain degree of seniority or have enough blue chips on your resume. You just get to skip the whole dance everyone else has to do. The company names are enough.

A portfolio is a glorified resume. It's something you update begrudgingly before applying for jobs, and then forget about until it's time to do that whole dance again.

And then I let it languish until the shine of a new job has dulled

I've felt the draw to build something again, to improve my little online space—and yes, full disclosure, I _am_ looking for a new job. But the more I thought about putting those old case studies back up, about writing (and rewriting) these same narratives,

- Research: where did the design portfolio come from?
- Lots of different professions have "portfolios", they just call them different things.
- It's natural to want to see _what kind of work_ someone does in order to evaluate them

From _show, don't tell_ (images only), to _show, and tell_ (case studies), to _neither show or tell_ (senior!).

- The discipline of digital design has taken many cues from graphic, print design
  - Manifests in different ways: like designers today still working primarily in a static medium, creating mockups which are then handed off to a developer to go and build

## This is not a portfolio.

## Digital Gardening

- What is it
- What is it not
- Why does it feel especially appealing at this moment
  - Slower growth
  - Control over the form and the pace
  - Indie web, own your own tech, use open source, build on web foundations: no link rot

## Site goals

- I want this to be a space to learn in public. -> Links to learning in public.
  - Learning about writing. Generative art. Synths.
  - No pressure for everything to be perfect. Ok with being wrong. Ok with input from others. Signal that
- I want this to be a place for exploration and seasonal growth.
  - Seasonal growth means my writing will ebb and flow. I'm not setting myself strict timelines around when or how much to write. I'm not going to "make content" just to make content—there's... enough of that.

## What's _this site_ for?

- Me
- Others

Should this be one entry? More? Am I trying to cover too much?
