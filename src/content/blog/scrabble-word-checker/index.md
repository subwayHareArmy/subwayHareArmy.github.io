## It checks Scrabble rules

<br>

Don't worry if you don't remember all the rules, SWC remembers them for you. Ask it if you can use a proper noun:

> User: Ok Google, talk to Scrabble Word Checker<br>
> SWC: < Greeting Message > 

<br>
 
> User: Is Nile a valid Scrabble word?<br>
> SWC: No, Nile is not a valid Scrabble word.<br>

## It gives you a tile score

<br>

Get a tile score when you enter a valid word:

> User: Ok Google, talk to Scrabble Word Checker <br>
> SWC: < Greeting Message >

<br>
 
> User: Is carrot okay?<br>
> SWC: Yes, carrot is a valid Scrabble word. You'll get a score of 8 for it.<br>

## Need some secrecy?

<br>

Want to check a word, but don't want to say it out loud? SWC's got you. You can type in our query, instead!
