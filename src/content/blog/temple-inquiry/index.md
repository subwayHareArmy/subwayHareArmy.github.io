<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->

Ever doubt the people's claims of the Ram Mandir being constructed here? <br>
Need Kunal Kamra to assure you that the temple will be built here? <br>

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->   

Do you ever feel the need to keep yourself updated on where the Ram Mandir would be constructed? <br>  

Regardless of your answer, this is this temple inquiry skill for you.  <br>
Open the [Temple Inquiry](https://www.amazon.com/Mandir-Kaha-Banega-Temple-Inquiry/dp/B07TG312YZ) and inquire away!  <br>    

[DISCLAIMER: Foreign Language Involved] - This skill contains usage of Hindi words in the audio responses. <br>       

I always wanted to make voice apps for the Alexa and Google Assistant platforms. I decided to make a gag one, this one. <br>
I'd planned on releasing it but soon realized that it was the day after before the final Supreme Court verdict. I decided that it would be best to not release it anywhere close to those events, instead I chose to release it now. [Go ahead](https://www.amazon.com/Mandir-Kaha-Banega-Temple-Inquiry/dp/B07TG312YZ), have fun with it.  <br>
