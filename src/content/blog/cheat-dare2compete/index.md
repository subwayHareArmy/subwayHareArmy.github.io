[Dare2Compete](https://dare2compete.com/) aggregates information about competitions, internships, jobs, quizzes, and hackathons. <br> There's healthy participation from E-School and B-School students from all over the country. <br> Dare2Compete works on the platform business model, it provides you the ability to host event for free and only charges a fee when you promote an event. <br>

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->   

# The Problem    

The platform has a loyal audience that regularly keeps checking the event catalog for new events and competitions. There was a visible uptick in the number of new remote events during the COVID-19 imposed lockdown. A friend and I decided that Dare2Compete would be the best way to host our '[*The Office*](https://theofficeslack.com/)' themed quiz. We soon realized that individuals aren't allowed to host events on the website. You need to have an incorporated company to host one.    

# The Solution    

The answer was obvious â€” fake a company. They needed an incorporated company with a valid website and a logo. In the end we came up with this - [BuzzFloss Quizzing LLP](https://subwayharearmy.github.io/pages/buzz-floss-quizzing.html).     <br>       
  
Designing a logo, writing content, getting photos, making, and hosting a webpage took under 30 mins. Surprisingly, the longest task was coming up with an obviously fake name. <br>

In the end, we were able to get an event page for [our quiz](https://dare2compete.com/o/the-office-quiz-buzzfloss-quizzing-llp-106752) on Dare2Compete. We never got around to making questions and hosting the quiz though. <br> <br>
