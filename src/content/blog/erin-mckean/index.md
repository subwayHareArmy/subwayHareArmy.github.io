<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Recently, I got a chance to interview [Erin McKean](https://www.ted.com/talks/erin_mckean_go_ahead_make_up_new_words/reading-list?referrer=playlist-how_language_changes_over_time), [lexicographer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_McKean) extraordinaire, author of over half a dozen books, and founder at [Wordnik](https://www.wordnik.com/), the world's biggest online English dictionary by number of words. She previously worked as the editor in chief of US Dictionaries for Oxford University Press. McKean is also well known for formulating 'McKean's law', also known as Muphry's law: "Any correction of the speech or writing of others will contain at least one grammatical, spelling or typographical error."   

The interview had been in the books for quite a long time, but I finally got around to sending her the questions. This is a draft, I shall update it soon.
