<br>

Recently, I got a chance to interview [Erin McKean](https://www.ted.com/talks/erin_mckean_go_ahead_make_up_new_words/reading-list?referrer=playlist-how_language_changes_over_time), [lexicographer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_McKean) extraordinaire, author of over half a dozen books, and founder at [Wordnik](https://www.wordnik.com/), the world's biggest online English dictionary by number of words. 

<br>

She previously worked as the editor in chief of US Dictionaries for Oxford University Press. McKean is also well known for formulating 'McKean's law', also known as Muphry's law: "Any correction of the speech or writing of others will contain at least one grammatical, spelling or typographical error."   

<br>

The interview had been in the books for quite a long time, but I finally got around to sending her the questions. This is a draft, I shall update it soon.
