<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->

At 19, [**Matt Mullenweg**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg) founded [**WordPress**](https://wordpress.org), which powers **34%** of all websites, and is arguably the majority stakeholder of the internet.

Unsurprisingly, he maintains his blog, [**Ma.tt**](https://ma.tt/), on WordPress. He started blogging at age 19 and has been going strong since. Even at the expense sounds creepy, I'll say it anyway - I've read almost all of _Matt Mullenweg_'s birthday posts in one sitting. Here are excerpts in chronological order:

>The most significant device to me in 2009 wasn’t the iPhone, it was the Kindle.

>Leaving my Kindle Oasis at an airport ended up being a blessing in disguise as I started using the Kindle app on my iPhone a lot more and that’s become my new favorite habit. (And the physical Kindle was returned!)  

What a journey. :)

Forgive my omission, I left out all the good things that the blog talks about. I highly recommend reading his blog, there's a lot to learn, like the importance of small formative habits and their role in accomplishing bigger goals.
