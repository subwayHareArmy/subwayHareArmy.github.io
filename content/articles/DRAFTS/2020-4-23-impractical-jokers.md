<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->  

On rewatching the first 4 seasons of Impractical Jokers on Netflix during the lockdown, Joe Gatto seemed to lose dispproportionately fewer times compared to the rest.  
I'm compiling I list of all thumb-downs, punishments, and challenges lost for each Joker. Done with collecting the data for the first season, 4 more to go.
