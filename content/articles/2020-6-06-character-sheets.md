<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->



# Introduction  

*Character Sheets* is a layer of interactivity, built on top of conventional ebook formats like `.epub` and `.azw3`. <br>
As the name suggests, *Character Sheets* was a simple framework to address a common fiction reader's problem - keeping track of all the characters. Since then, the scope of the project has broadened. It now deals with adding interactivity and functionality to ebooks. 

For examples, think about *Black Mirror*'s Bandersnatch and *Goosebumps*' choose-your-own-adventure books. 

In brief:

# Technical Details  

It's modelled on the [World Wide Web Consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium), **W3C**'s `EPUB 3.0` standard. A combination of simple two-way links, JS scripting, and HTML elements have been used to implement it. Most of it was done using normal text editors, however, I recently started using the '*Calibre E-book Management*' software which has made the process very efficient.    

The `EPUB 3.0` standard is very expansive and currently, none of the big-name ebook readers support all of the functionality that the 3.0 standard supports. For testing the prototypes, I've been using the *Moon+ Reader* (Android), *Calibre Reader* (Windows), and a *Kindle Paperwhite* (For `.azw3`) for all testing. For best results, stick to using these. 

I'm happy to announce that I'd applied to be a part of the **W3C**'s EPUB Community Group, and have been accepted. Here, I shall contribute to the discussions, giving direction to the standard's development.
