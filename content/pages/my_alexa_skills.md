Privacy Policy for Alexa Skills
===============================

This document serves as the privacy policy and describes how I (Ayush Yembarwar) ["subwayHareArmy", "me" or "I"] protect your ["you", "user" or "customer"] privacy and keep all your personal data safe in all the Alexa Skills that I've published ["Mandir Kaha Banega? :  Temple Inquiry"].
Be sure to read this policy as well as Amazon's [Alexa Terms of Use](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201809740), and [Alexa, Echo Devices, and Your Privacy](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_left_v4_sib?ie=UTF8&nodeId=GVP69FUJ48X9DK8V).

If you use one of my skills you fully agree to this privacy policy.


General
-------

When the user activates a skill, their voice input is sent to Amazon and is processed to realize the user's intent.

This data exchange is not avoidable.


Data
----

I do not collect any other user data for any of my Skills.

Amazon's Alexa Development Console logs data of the form of the frequency of requests and utterances(not tied to a specific user) as a part of their analytics package for Skill improvements.


Changes
-------

The Skills and the Privacy Policy might change at a later point of time, as a part of the changes and updates made to the Skills.

Your continued use of the skill after changes of the Privacy Policy or the skill itself will be seen as your acceptance of both.
