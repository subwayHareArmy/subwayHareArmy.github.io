# What does fundee do?  

Simple. fundee rewards you for purchasing on Amazon. A percentage of whatever you buy on Amazon is donated to charities, on your behalf.     

<br>  

# How do I use it?  

Install the extension. Buy stuff on Amazon.    
That's it, fundee does the rest.  

<br>  

# How does it work?  

Take a look at the [Amazon Affiliate Program](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/amazon-affiliate). When someone signs up as an affiliate with Amazon, they receive a tag. They can make affiliate links with this tag and advertise them. When someone buys through this link, Amazon pays the affiliate a commission.   
<br>
fundee is a part of affiliate programs in multiple countries. Our web extension converts adds fundee's affiliate tag to any Amazon product page that you view. We do so non-invasively, you won't notice a difference. Browse normally. When you make a purchase, fundee is paid a percentage (2% to 14%) which we donate to charities on your behalf. Simple as that.  

<br>  

# Do you track me or store my data?  

fundee does not store any data. Period. It can only interact with Amazon's websites and does not interfere anywhere else.   

<br>  

# Does it slow me down?

The extension just adds an affiliate tag at the end of Amazon URLs. It doesn't slow you down.
